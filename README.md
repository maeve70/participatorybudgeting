participatory budgeting Ultimately, this data was a mess. The survey needs to be corrected to not have overlapping age categories amongst other things. I hope that the city corrects the survey questions going forward b/c some valuable insights could be gleaned from the data about who participates and who doesn't/needs more outreach.
