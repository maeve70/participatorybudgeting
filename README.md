participatory budgeting in NYC. Data from NYC Open Data: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Participatory-Budgeting-Survey-Data/wa6b-r9jh
Ultimately, this survey data was a mess. The survey needs to be corrected to not have overlapping age categories amongst other things. I hope that the city corrects the survey questions going forward b/c some valuable insights could be gleaned from the data about who participates and who doesn't/needs more outreach.
